## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The application follows a traditional multi-page web architecture with separated concerns:

- **HTML Structure**: Semantic HTML5 markup with proper meta tags and accessibility features
- **CSS Organization**: Modular CSS with separate files for main styles (`style.css`) and responsive design (`responsive.css`)
- **JavaScript Modules**: Separated into functional modules - `main.js` for core functionality and `animations.js` for visual effects
- **Design System**: CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent theming and maintainable styling

### Responsive Design Strategy
The site uses a mobile-first approach with Bootstrap 5 integration:

- **Grid System**: Bootstrap's responsive grid for layout management
- **Breakpoint Strategy**: Custom media queries for extra large (1400px+), large (992px-1399px), and medium (768px-991px) devices
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript, with enhanced features layered on top

### Animation and Interaction System
The architecture includes sophisticated animation handling:

- **Intersection Observer API**: For scroll-triggered animations with performance optimization
- **Motion Preferences**: Respects user's reduced motion preferences for accessibility
- **Staggered Animations**: Coordinated timing for visual elements entering the viewport
- **Counter Animations**: Numerical data visualization with smooth counting effects

### Performance Optimization
The system implements several performance strategies:

- **Lazy Loading**: Intersection Observer for efficient resource loading
- **Animation Debouncing**: Prevents excessive animation triggers during scrolling
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when features fail to load
- **CDN Integration**: External libraries loaded from CDNs for faster delivery

## External Dependencies

### CSS Frameworks and Libraries
- **Bootstrap 5.3.0**: Responsive grid system and UI components
- **Font Awesome 6.4.0**: Icon library for visual elements
- **Google Fonts**: Playfair Display and Source Sans Pro for typography

### Browser APIs
- **Intersection Observer API**: For scroll-triggered animations and lazy loading
- **CSS Custom Properties**: For dynamic theming and responsive design
- **Media Query API**: For detecting user motion preferences

### Development Tools
- **CDN Delivery**: All external dependencies loaded via CDN for performance
- **Modern JavaScript**: ES6+ features with fallback considerations
- **CSS Grid and Flexbox**: Modern layout techniques for responsive design

The architecture prioritizes accessibility, performance, and maintainability while providing a rich, interactive user experience for showcasing executive profiles and achievements.
